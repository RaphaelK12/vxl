# vxl
vxl is a lightweight SIMD vector, quaternion and matrix library for vectors and matrices of small dimensions. The library supports SSE, NEON and the gcc/clang vector extensions. This makes it suitable for every architecture/platform, that gcc and clang support, even i586/msdos and the ECMAScript (browser) virtual machines, among many others.

The test .cpp files should provide clues on how to use the library. A C++17 compliant compiler is needed to use the library and to complle the .cpp files.
